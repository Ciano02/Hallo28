            <h2>Some of my Notes that I've written over the past few weeks ❤️</h2>
            <p>Doubt is natural in every single small or big decision that we make in life. From choosing what sweets we want to buy in the shop to deciding on a career path or to pursuing a relationship with someone. I had big doubts before asking you out on the 26/08/2020. I followed my heart and my gut and took the leap of faith and by God I am happier than anything that I overcame those doubts to get to where we are. I know we both have that voice in our head that is doubting what we can have in the future. But I still, without any question, am going to fight for what we have. I am ready to take that leap of faith again, knowing what we can have in the future. Love is the most precious emotion that anyone can have and we are so so lucky to have experienced this love that we have. I am not anywhere near ready to give up on that love. Our judgements are obviously very clouded with everything that's going on with stresses (including those from college/work/sport), but reading some of the cards you have given me over the years once again reminded me of how much I love you. I cannot wait to make so many more memories with you and grow so much as a person by your side and to see you become the person that I fully know you can. There is only one person that I want to be with for the rest of my life and that's you my girl ❤️</p>
            <p>Times are obviously really tough for us at the moment but my love for you is what gives me hope and motivates me through every day. I am really excited for the next chapter in our life, one where we grow so much individually and together. Tough times never last but tough people do</p>
            <p>What we have is, in my eyes, definitely worth fighting for. Across all aspects of life the best things come after hard work and sacrifice. Perseverance through hard times and seeing the rewards only make the good times sweeter. Like training hard all year and fighting as hard as you can to end up winning championship or you for instance fighting so hard during college despite so many things against you and to still end up with a first. That fight and perseverance that you have within you is something I'm so proud of and I really admire that in you. I really believe that what we have is not worth giving up on because of a few bad months. We are at our lowest point ever now but I firmly believe the only way is up from here if we get back together. I've learned so much over the last few weeks and above all I think the biggest thing I've learned is that I took what we had for granted. I became complacent and too comfortable in the relationship and this led to bad habits forming like not making enough effort and not treating you the way you deserve to be treated. The best things in life, from my experience, are things you have to work the hardest for and I promise I will work harder than ever to make this work because I know what we have is worth it</p>
            <p>Like any great story there are very low points but it only makes the good times feel better and I believe there's so many good times awaiting us in our next chapter. I really believe we can become stronger than ever after this ❤️</p>
            <p>I got too comfortable and complacent in what we had and that led to this. This has really given me complete clarity on what I want, I know I keep saying it but it's true. I want those memories that we had to continue and I want to grow with you. I really believe we can get back to where we once were and even better. Life is about sharing memories and good times with people you love and I want to spend my life with you. I lost touch with this meaning of life at times over the last year especially and it's resulted in this. I want to celebrate and share my memories with you and only you. You make every happy moment 10 times better and ever sad moment 10 times more manageable and that, to me, is a real sign of how much you mean to me ❤️ </p>
            <p>Actions speak much louder than words and we can sit here talking about what we want but at the end of the day our future trust will be built on the actions we both take. That started with the cards that you wrote me for the our anniversary and my graduation. These small things meant so much to me and made me realise why I fell in love with you and why I still am in love with you so much. It reminded me of who you really are and I believe one moment on one night will not define you or us xxx</p>

            <h2><u>Top 10 Happiest/Loving Moments</u></h2>
            <p>As the emotions swirled from day to day I began to get more clarity on what I really wanted. I want you. What really helped me find this clarity was thinking back on the countless happy memories we have had together. There are too many to count and I've probably forgotten some of them because there's so many of them lol but here are the top 10 that came to mind (So difficult to choose the top 10 btw)!!</p>
